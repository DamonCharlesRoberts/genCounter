I developed this webapp for researchers and other users to be able to utilize the Gendered Language Dictionary developed by [Roberts and Utych (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912919874883).

The webapp allows users to upload a document. The app will then count the number of words contained in the document, and it will then create a score based on the average score of all of the words in the document that matches with those in the Gendered Language Dictionary.

This webapp is a quick side project that I worked on during my dissertation. So use at your own risk. You should not upload documents containing any sensitive information. I do have a scheduling script on the server to delete documents daily. But this still does not protect the user completely. 

If there are issues with the webapp or if you'd like to request new features, please do so on the issues tab of this repository.
