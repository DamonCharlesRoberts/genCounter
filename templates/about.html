        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>What is genCounter?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A webapp to help researchers use the gendered language dictionary developed by <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912919874883" target="_blank">Roberts and Utych (2019)</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How does genCounter work?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upload a .txt file and genCounter will match the words in your file to the gendered language dictionary. It will then give the document a score based on the "genderedness" of the text in the document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How was the gendered language dictionary developed?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used Amazon's MTURK platform to crowdsource words that people perceived as masculine, feminine, or neutral that are common in politics.</li>
            <li>Participants gave these scores to each word on a 1-7 scale (closer to 1 is feminine and closer to 7 is masculine).
            </li>
            <li>As this was developed to examine political texts, this may not be appropriate to determine the "genderedness" of texts outside of the political domain.</li>
        </ul>
